This is an example file for reflection in IBI1_2024-25.
During this course, I have learnt how to manage my work through VScode, and how to commit changes, how to clone online files etc.
The challenge I faced was how to merge the branches or keep Github related to the local (get solved now).
I found that sometimes committing needs a long time, I'll change to a private VPN based in US.
