This is a feedback for the change made to the formative part and more original work finished later this semster.
Week 3:  Most of them were absent before because of equipment change (Windows_Mac), and I hadn't finished the information transportation that time. (Sorry about this!) I resubmitted my previous work for week 3 after the formative feedback, and additionally create a new personal website.
Week 4: It received 100% (^_^)
Week 5: In language.py, multiple languages were used as examples, and the name of outputted print statement was given. In population.py, two orders 'UK_countries.sort()' and 'CN_provinces.sort()' were added to sort the data.
 
For more original works: The lectures sometimes provided insufficient information for practicals, which made its fun to explore the methods/functions/... myself. I learned to use a lot of tools like panda, metapolib, xml.dom.minidom etc., and now have an overall understanding about bioinformatics and those computational work with interest.
